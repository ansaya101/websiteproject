<p><h1> Unit 1-Outcome 1</h1></p>
<h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2> 
<p>The term IT is an abbreviation for Information Technology, “It refers to anything related to computing technology, such as networking, hardware, software, the Internet, or the people that work with these technologies.”[1] It essentially means that we are receiving and giving information via technology, and in certain careers (particularly those who work in an IT department) it becomes an essential part of their job.</p>
<p>Using IT can help a business grow through enabeling communication to a wider audience, produce systems to increase productivity and can be environmentally friendly by reducing the need for paper.</p>
<h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
<p>In order to complete a digital project you first and foremost need: a computer/ laptop to perform the process on, coding knowledge /skills and patience. There also needs to be software downloaded on your computer or laptop that can perform coding tasks such as Visual Studio Code, this is so you have a way to perform the tasks for your digital project, without it the digital project won’t be successful</p>
<p>Some projects take more time than others and so to help keep everything organised online personal organisers such as trello can help with this. Using Trello helps you keep on track and up to date on your work which is essential to a successful digital project. Another resource that is helpful is github as it is a great way to store/save and share your work, by doing this you are making your work accessible which is also essential to a successful project.</p>
<h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your troll board. </h2>
<p>Before starting a website project there needs to be a plan in place that will give a structured idea of the progress of the project. In order to do this I used Trello and created a board called Code Nation Project 1, which stored information in a simple format based on what I needed to do in this project.<a class = "link" href = "https://trello.com/b/HSVZHcbH/code-nation-project-1"target= "_blank"> Link to Trello page </a> </p>
<h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why? </h2>
<p>Many issues can arise during a digital project, on of these issues could be a computer failure. Although technology works most of the time, there are times where it might glitch, freeze or a delete and important file. This can hinder the progression of the project and consume valuable time trying to fix it.</p>
<p>Another issue with digital projects is that it could open you up to hacking, which although is unlikely, could still be a potential risk. Digital projects could also leave you open to viruses which could badly impair your computer and also impact your ability to continue with your digital project.</p>
<h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </h2>
<p>If I hadn’t been told which IT systems and software I needed to use then I would have gone on the internet or the library to research what I would have needed. Particularly with the internet there are so many different ways to access this type of information and in different medias media types such as in the form of video on youtube or written blogs. Another way I could have gone about selecting the IT systems and software could be similar to how I did find out, by speaking to an expert and sort their advice.</p>
<h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
<p>Using Trello was extremely useful, this is because it is essentially an online to do list organizer, it provided a way to keep up with the work that needs to be done and is in a user friendly format that I could taylor to my needs. This helped keep my work organised as I could specifically see what i needed to do in a clear way.</p>
<p>Using GitHub wasn’t as simple as Trello because of all the code words, I felt I would have needed very detailed instruction booklet on how to use it if I didn’t have someone giving me the instructions. The main reason being is that there are a lot of different processes going on which were labeled used jargon which wasn’t user friendly for everyone. However, it did allow me to store my work securely and be able to share with anyone that i needed to which was helpful to my project.</p>
<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>
<p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and is an EU regulation on data protection which applies to all members of the EU and EAU. “The aim of the GDPR is to protect all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches in today’s data-driven world.” [2] It affects the way data is stored, for example data protection by design and data protection by default ensures that the data is processed in a protective manner and that no unnecessary data is obtained. They also set out to ensure that the data is obtained with fully informed consent and be be accessed (right to access), modified (Data Portability) or withdrawn (right to be forgotten) by the ‘data subject’ Not only is data collection important but also the monitoring of it, in many big companies a Data Protection Officers will be enforced when using “processing operations which require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale or of special categories of data or data relating to criminal convictions and offences.” [3] In any case of data breach the GDPR makes sure it is the responsibility of the company to report it, and in cases where there is a risk of harm the ‘data subject’ must be notified within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach. The ‘Increased Territorial Scope (extraterritorial applicability)’ means that the GDPR has increased jurisdiction. This means that they are not limited by the location or size of a business and will fine those in breach of the ‘data subjects’ security. This impacts digital products because it puts a guideline on how to obtain and store data and impacts what data you can collect even if you a small business such as an independent person working from home or someone making a website/blog.</p>
