<p><h1> Unit 1-Outcome 2 </h1></p>
<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h2>
<p> I used many tools throughout this digital project including Visual Studio Code, Trello, GitHub and Slack. They all contributed to me being able to finish my digital project however, some were more useful than others. I found Visual Studio Code was the most useful in helping me create my blog and therefore was happy that i used that tool. In regards to Trello, I found it useful however i’m not sure if it was any more effective than pen and paper in its job role however that’s not to say I wasn’t happy using it.</p>
<p>I have a similar perspective on GitHub and Slack in that although they were useful in helping me share my project, they both had little impact in actually helping me complete my project. In particular I found GitHub difficult to navigate which added to my scepticism of using the tool especially as it didn’t help with completing my project as well. However, without them my project might have taken longer or might have struggled without them, and so despite being unhappy with them i might have been unhappier without them.</p>
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello </h2>
<p>During this project I have used Visual Studio Code, Trello, GitHub and Slack which were all appropriate to use for different reasons. Visual Studio Code was appropriate because it was able to create my website. Trello was an appropriate tool to help keep my work organised and keep on track with what i needed to do which is useful in any project. Slack and GitHub were appropriate to use in this project as a tool to be able to share my work and communicate with other developers which was needed in this project. Altogether they were appropriate tools which worked well together and helped create my finished project.</p>
<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change? </h2>
<p>I feel the overall look of the website is cohesive and all the elements merge well together, it is also well functioning and the links work the way they should, which is a huge strength and I'm proud to have been able to make a working website. One issue that I have with it is that I decided on a specific theme early on in the project, this particular theme made me feel restricted later on in the project to some extent in as I had to be careful of what i could put on so that the theme was not disrupted. If i was to start again i would perhaps put more thought into the planning stage of what I wanted and use a theme that would have complemented a webpage with lots of details.</p>   
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project </h2>
<p>If I was given more time on the project I could improve it by adding more features that extend past the links and photos I have. I think there are ways to make it more interactive and play around with the navigation bar which would not only make it more interesting but also show off more skills and techniques.</p>
<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2>
<p>The outcome of the project was to “Plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet needs” I have used the IT system of Visual Studio Code on a Mac which I was informed before starting my digital project would help me meet the brief of “creating a blog talking about yourself, why you are interested in technology and demonstrate how much you know.” Therefore, the IT system and software were appropriate as it allowed me to create a blog which showed off my knowledge and skill of being able to create a website and because of this it matched the requirements and was fit for purpose.</p>
