<p><h1> Unit 1-Outcome 3 </h1></p>
<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
<p>The benefit of using Visual Studio Code is that you are able to perform Javascript which is useful in helping create a website. However, one disadvantage is that in order to create a website IT tools are needed and the system process need to be learned which is time consuming but essential in making a website.</p>
<p>Although working as team would usually help efficiency, if this project was to be done as a team there are issues that arise such as a clash of control, and there would need to be a higher level of organization of planning everyone's role. Therewould also be the issue of only one person being able to edit the work at any one time which would counteract any benefit of teamwork.</p>    
<p>I found that working next to people and being able to show them my project was really effective because they could offer feedback and we were able to exchange different ways we had done something. This seemed to draw in some of the good things about working in a team without the downside of a full collaboration.</p>
<h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
<p>One way to improve productivity and efficiency is to have mini break intervals so that you can rejuvenate and return refreshed and see your work in a different light. The surrounding work environment is also important, knowing where you are going to be the most focused on your work is critically important. Some people like absolute silence, therefore they need to find a quiet space to work, while others might thrive with a bit of background noise and be inspired by working with people around them. In regards to efficiency, setting goals can help you manage your time, for example setting a goal that in 1 hour this amount of work should be done.</p>
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
<p>During this project I didn’t use Slack often if anything at all however if I was to do it again perhaps I would use it more to communicate with others, share ideas and learn other techniques I hadn’t thought of. This would be one solution to improving productivity is making full use of the tools available.</p> 
<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
<p>One of the main ways I would go about testing a digital solution is to use a method called ‘User Testing’.“User testing refers to a technique used in the design process to evaluate a product, feature or prototype with real users” [5] it’s an effective method to test digital solutions as helps find any issues, obtain feedback and gauge whether is user friendly, even for those with low digital skills. It is a relatively cheap, time effective way to test out a product and allow time to fix/adjust any issues that may not be immediately obvious.</p>
