<h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
<p>As a norfolk country girl at heart, I went with a norfolk beach background to reflect this, it also gave a calming and tranquil feel which i felt was aesthetically pleasing. I also changed the font to complement this theme, the one that ended up being selected was less stiff  that some of the other fonts and added a girly touch which reflected my feminine girly side. At the top is the navigation bar, i kept it simplistic in order for the website to look cohesive and match the theme I was going for. The color of the font for the navigation bar was changed to pink to make it distinguishable from the rest of the content and also to add a bit more of a girl theme.</p> 
<p>On the index page i included a collage of photos of my favourite musicals, this was done through a photo editing website which i then included into the page. I felt this added character to the website as opposed to just have words and the background behind the images are translucent so that it merged more fluently.
<p>On the contact me page i included a photo of me so that it made it more personal, when people try and contact you it makes it more helpful to get an idea of who they are talking to. Being able to have the contact details next to the picture was involved more effort however, the end product makes it look put together.</p>
<h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
<p> When it comes to your own work copyright is a way to protect your work and prevent others from using it without your permission. This extends to people distributing copies, renting/lending copies of your work, performing (even an adaption) or distributing it on the internet. It is automatic and free process that protects: original literary (dramatic, musical and artistic work), original non-literary written work (software, web content and databases), sound/music recordings, film or television recordings, broadcasts and the layout of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works. [4] Although it protects your own work, it can become an issue when making an independent website because it means having to be cautious of what images to use in case there is a copyright claim.</p> 
<p>Another constraint is being able to make the website user friendly, this is known as a creative constraint as it means that it’s not just the creator that has to be able to navigate round but also the user of the website, it can look amazing fun and animated but if the user can’t navigate round then it makes it pointless.</p>
<h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using web pages and how we can overcome them </h2>
<p>One issue with access is that people with reduced eyesight may struggle to read text if it isn’t apparent enough. One way to overcome this is to make the text larger and make sure the text colour is distinguishable from the background.</p>
<p>Another issue that needs to be taken into account is the navigation of the webpage needs to be easy as some might not be able to navigate such a complicated web page. </p>
<h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites </h2> 
<p>The file type for a websites will end with a .html at the end, signifying that it is a webpage/website. Any photos that go onto the website will be either JPEG/ JPG (Joint Photographics Expert Group),PNG, GIF (for animated photos) or SVG. When naming the files they need to be named using Camel Case, this is where the middle phrase begins with a capital letter, there should also be no spaces or punctuation within the title either.</p>
